Legacy Infusion

By Seedlessbuns

Infusion is back baby! This mod allows you to change or remove the maximum hp from infusion, and grants 1 max hp per infusion on killing enemies, just like in Risk of Rain 1.

V 1.0.1: Removed testing code that gave infusions on pressing F2 (ooops)

V 1.1.0: Created config file to set a hp limit per infusion

V 1.1.1: Removed testing code AGAIN (what is wrong with me)
